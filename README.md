# cleaner-robot-probe
A small project as part of a job application

## What is this all about
I got to do solve a small fun problem:
* Program a robot that is to clean an office
* The robot is confined to an area
* The robot needs to report which stations where cleaned

## Why to share?
I figure that other people would be interesed in having a look at the code
